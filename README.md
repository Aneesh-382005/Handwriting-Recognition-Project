# Handwriting Recognition Project

This project uses the **IAM Handwriting Word Database** for training and testing a handwriting recognition model. The IAM dataset contains a large collection of handwritten English words and their corresponding transcriptions, which is useful for building and evaluating handwriting recognition systems.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is the [IAM Handwriting Word Database](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/nibinv23/iam-handwriting-word-database/code), which is available on Kaggle. It includes images of handwritten words and their ground-truth transcriptions.

### How to Download the Dataset

To use this dataset, follow these steps:

1. Visit the [IAM Handwriting Word Database Kaggle page](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/nibinv23/iam-handwriting-word-database/code).
2. Sign in to Kaggle (or create an account if you don't have one).
3. Download the dataset by clicking on the "Download" button on the Kaggle page.
4. Extract the contents of the dataset to the appropriate directory in your project.

The expected folder structure after extracting the dataset should look like this:
